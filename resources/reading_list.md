# Reading List
Academic success in college is a function of effort and learning stategies, which I have explained on the [first ramp up lesson](https://github.com/SprintWithCarlos/data_science_course/blob/main/0.ramp_up/0.how_to_learn.md).   
Processing and reviewing schoolwork should be an individual daily habit and a (at least) weekly cojoint effort with others (tutor, peer or group).   
To get beliefs and actions aligned in a practical way, I recommend the book Atomic Habits by James Clear, that leverages concepts from cognitive-behavioral therapy to promote attributional retraining. Here's a [summary](https://fourpillarfreedom.com/atomic-habits-by-james-clear/) of the book, I kindly recommend to read it and share opinions about it with tutor and peers. [How To Start New Habits That Actually Stick - James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change)  
Finally, as an additional reference I recommend the book [Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python](https://books.google.com.co/books?id=YBKSDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=es#v=onepage&q&f=false), especially the first two chapters that you will find freely available here.
Also this great resource for learning statistics basics from [Brown University](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/)

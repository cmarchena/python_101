Greetings and welcome to our course! My name is [Carlos](https://github.com/cmarchena) and I'll be supporting you in your learning journey.  
To provide you with the best possible experience, please answer the following questions:  

## 1. What are your learning goals?
## 2. How far are you in your learning journey?
## 3. How much time are you allocating for learning?


This is a private repository so only we have access to it, please answer via email o message this time.

Once you answer the questions and registered to the [platform](https://github.com") (it's free, only need an email account), I will send you the first assigment that you will answer using the platform so you can start getting familiarity with it. You will also have access to the [course repository](https://github.com/SprintWithCarlos/data_science_course)
In the meanwhile, I will send you each day supporting material as preparation for our first class next Thursday.

Hope you are doing well and looking forward to start!

Kind regards,
Carlos
